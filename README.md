#Limelight

Limelight is an open source implementation of NVIDIA's GameStream, as used by the NVIDIA Shield,
but built for Windows Phone 8. 

Limelight-windows-phone allows you to stream your full collection of Steam games from
your powerful Windows desktop to your Windows Phone 8 Device. 

[Limelight](https://github.com/limelight-stream/limelight) also has an Android
implementation, and versions for PC and iOS are currently in development.
