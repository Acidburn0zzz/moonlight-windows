#Limelight

This is in development and is not considered stable (or buildable). Do not use it. It is not ready.

Limelight is an open source implementation of NVIDIA's GameStream, as used by the NVIDIA Shield,
but built for Windows Phone 8. 

Limelight-wp allows you to stream your full collection of Steam games from
your powerful Windows desktop to your Windows Phone 8 Device. 

[Limelight](https://github.com/limelight-stream) also has an Android
implementation, and versions for PC and iOS are currently in development.
